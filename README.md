# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis in Software Development** repository!  

This repository is dedicated to exploring the critical phase of **requirement analysis** in the software development lifecycle. Here, we aim to analyze, document, and understand the requirements of a software project, which serves as the foundation for successful development.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software product. It serves as the foundation of the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** by ensuring that all parties involved have a clear understanding of the goals and functionality of the system being developed.

## Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are broadly categorized into **Functional Requirements** and **Non-functional Requirements**. Both types are essential to ensure the system meets the users' needs and operates effectively.

---

### Functional Requirements

**Functional Requirements** define what the system should do. These are the specific behaviors or functions that the system must perform to meet the needs of the users and stakeholders.  

#### Examples for a Booking Management System:
1. **Search Functionality**  
   - The system must allow users to search for available rooms by date, location, and room type.
2. **Room Booking**  
   - The system must enable users to book rooms by entering their personal details and payment information.
3. **User Registration and Login**  
   - The system must provide users with the ability to register an account and log in securely.
4. **Booking Cancellation**  
   - Users must be able to cancel their reservations and receive a refund as per the cancellation policy.
5. **Payment Integration**  
   - The system must support multiple payment methods, such as credit cards, PayPal, and bank transfers.

---

### Non-functional Requirements

**Non-functional Requirements** define how the system should perform its functions. These requirements often relate to the quality attributes of the system, such as performance, security, and usability.

#### Examples for a Booking Management System:
1. **Performance**  
   - The system should handle up to 1,000 concurrent users without any noticeable decrease in performance.
2. **Reliability**  
   - The system must ensure 99.9% uptime availability over a 12-month period.
3. **Scalability**  
   - The system should be scalable to accommodate future expansions, such as adding new locations or services.
4. **Security**  
   - All user data, including personal and payment information, must be encrypted using industry-standard protocols.
5. **Usability**  
   - The system should provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing users to complete a booking in no more than five steps.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Prevents Miscommunication**
2. **Reduces Development Costs**
3. **Ensures Project Success**

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

1. **Requirement Gathering**  
2. **Requirement Elicitation**  
3. **Requirement Documentation**  
4. **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
5. **Requirement Validation**

## Acceptance Criteria

### What are Acceptance Criteria?

**Acceptance Criteria** are a set of predefined conditions that a software feature must satisfy to be considered complete and acceptable by the stakeholders. These criteria define the scope and ensure that the development team and stakeholders have a shared understanding of what constitutes a successful implementation.

### Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis

- **Clarity and Focus**: Acceptance criteria provide a clear and concise definition of the requirements, ensuring that the development team knows exactly what needs to be delivered.  
- **Alignment**: They ensure alignment between stakeholders and the development team, reducing the risk of misunderstandings.  
- **Testing and Validation**: Acceptance criteria act as a benchmark for testing and validating the feature before deployment.  
- **Risk Mitigation**: By defining expectations upfront, acceptance criteria help identify potential issues early in the development cycle.

### Example: Acceptance Criteria for a Checkout Feature in a Booking Management System

Feature: **Checkout Process**  

#### Acceptance Criteria:
1. **Payment Method Selection**  
   - The user must be able to select a payment method from the following options: Credit Card, PayPal, and Bank Transfer.  
   - If no payment method is selected, the user should be prompted with an error message: *"Please select a payment method."*  

2. **Order Summary Display**  
   - The user must see an order summary, including the total cost, selected room(s), and booking dates, before proceeding to payment.  
   - The order summary must be updated dynamically if the user changes their booking details.

3. **Successful Payment Confirmation**  
   - After completing the payment, the system must display a confirmation message: *"Your booking is confirmed!"*  
   - The system must send a confirmation email to the user's registered email address, including booking details and payment receipt.  

4. **Error Handling**  
   - If payment fails, the user must see a detailed error message explaining the issue and options to retry or choose a different payment method.

With well-defined **Acceptance Criteria**, both stakeholders and developers have a clear understanding of the goals and success metrics for each feature, ensuring smooth and efficient development.
